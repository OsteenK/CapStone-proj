                        Before receiving donations from our organization, Fatima struggled every month to manage her menstrual cycle. Her family struggled to afford basic necessities, let alone sanitary products. This often meant that she had to miss school during her period, causing her to fall behind in her studies. Thanks to our donations, Fatima now has access to sanitary products and is able to attend school regularly.
